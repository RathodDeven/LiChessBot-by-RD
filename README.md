# LiChessBot-by-RD
This is code for a simple discord bot for lichess.org  to create challenge,create open challenge and create tournaments.

## Parts and its description

-> main.py is the core code, where code for discord bot along with lichess api are used.
-> keep_alive.py is used to keep the bot online and this file uses flask for the same.

--> I made this bot and deployed it on replit.com and on replit.com on free version flask server can run for 1 hour without any interuption thus I had used uptimerobot.com to ping the server contiously after every 45 minutes therefore the flask server remains active and Bot remians online as long as we want.
